# Parcel.js Boilerplate

### This is a static Front-End boilerplate which uses [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) to quickly get set up with some common frameworks and plugins.

#### They Include:

---

- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Font Awesome 5 Free](https://fontawesome.com/start)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Object-Fit Images](https://github.com/fregante/object-fit-images) (IE11 `object-fit` polyfill)
- [PostHTML Include](https://github.com/posthtml/posthtml-include) (for including HTML partials)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Select2](https://select2.org/) (for custom styling of `select` elements)
- [Slick Carousel](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

---

#### To Get Started:

---

**Note:** You will need node `v10` or higher.

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start a development server with LiveReload.
- Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to build all files and assets for production in a `dist` folder.
